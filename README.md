# Deadline Tracker
Basic webapp for keeping track of deadlines made using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

This project is close to being finished, but is not quite ready to be hosted on a website yet.

This project requires a MongoDB database. It also requires a .env file inside of the backend folder. You will also have to have node.js installed on your computer.

To run this code, open two terminals. In the first terminal change directory into the backend folder and then run the command "npm init". After this is finished run the command "node server.js". In the second terminal change directory into the frontend folder and run the command "npm init". After this is finished run the command "npm run start". The "npm init" command only needs to be run once in both frontend and backend. I recommend that you start the backend before the frontend.
