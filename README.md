# Deadline Tracker
Basic webapp for keeping track of deadlines made using MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

Note that to use this app you must create an account with an email and password. If you do not wish to put in your actual email feel free to use a fake email as I currently do not check if the entered email is valid. There is currently no way to change or recover your password.
